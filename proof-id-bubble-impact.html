        <h1>Characterization: When IDs Can Affect Bubble Statistics</h1>

        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Analysis of Swiss Tournament Simulator<br>
            <strong>Date:</strong> 2024<br>
            <strong>Question:</strong> Under what conditions on cut size (C) and number of rounds (R) can intentional
            draws affect bubble statistics?
        </p>

        <h2>1. Definitions and Setup</h2>

        <div class="definition">
            <h3>Definitions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C:</strong> Cut size (number of players who advance, e.g., C = 4 for Top 4, C = 8 for Top 8)
                </li>
                <li><strong>R:</strong> Total number of rounds in the tournament</li>
                <li><strong>r:</strong> Remaining rounds when ID decision is made (r ∈ {1, 2} since IDs only occur in
                    last 2 rounds)</li>
                <li><strong>N_passers(S):</strong> Number of players who could potentially finish with score ≥ S</li>
                <li><strong>Safety margin:</strong> How many additional potential passers a player can tolerate and
                    still be safe</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. The Safety Condition</h2>

        <p>A player with current score <span class="math">S</span> is <strong>safe after drawing</strong> if:</p>

        <div class="definition">
            <p><span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S + 1) < C</span>
            </p>
            <p>That is, fewer than C players can potentially finish with score ≥ S + 1.</p>
        </div>

        <p>A player is <strong>safe after losing</strong> if:</p>

        <div class="definition">
            <p><span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S) < C</span>
            </p>
            <p>That is, fewer than C players can potentially finish with score ≥ S.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. When Can IDs Affect Bubbles?</h2>

        <div class="theorem">
            <strong>Characterization:</strong> IDs can affect bubble statistics if and only if there exists a scenario
            where:
            <ol>
                <li>Two players A and B are both safe if they draw: <span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S<sub>A</sub>
                        + 1) < C</span> and <span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S<sub>B</sub> + 1) < C</span>
                </li>
                <li>But if A loses (getting 0 instead of 1): <span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S<sub>A</sub>) ≥
                        C</span></li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>This happens when the <strong>safety margin</strong> is exactly 0 or 1 for at least one player.</p>

        <h2>4. Constraints on Safety Margin</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Maximum Possible Score Gains</h3>

        <p>When an ID decision is made with <span class="math">r</span> remaining rounds:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Any other player (not in the match) can gain at most <span class="math">3r</span> points</li>
            <li>The opponent in the match can gain at most <span class="math">1 + 3r</span> points (if they draw) or
                <span class="math">3 + 3r</span> points (if they win)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Players Who Can Cross the S → S+1 Threshold</h3>

        <p>For IDs to affect bubbles, we need players who can reach exactly <span class="math">S</span> but not <span
                class="math">S + 1</span>.</p>

        <p>A player <span class="math">q</span> with current score <span class="math">S<sub>q</sub></span> can reach
            <span class="math">S</span> but not <span class="math">S + 1</span> if:
        </p>

        <div class="definition">
            <p><span class="math">S<sub>q</sub> + 3r ≥ S</span> and <span class="math">S<sub>q</sub> + 3r < S + 1</span>
            </p>
            <p>Which simplifies to: <span class="math">S - 3r ≤ S<sub>q</sub>
                    < S - 3r + 1</span>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>This is only possible if <span class="math">S ≡ 0 \pmod{3}</span> or <span class="math">S ≡ 1 \pmod{3}</span>
            (since scores are multiples of 3, with possible +1 for draws).</p>

        <h2>5. Characterization by Cut Size and Rounds</h2>

        <div class="characterization">
            <h3>Key Insight: Safety Margin Distribution</h3>

            <p>The safety margin for a player with score <span class="math">S</span> is:</p>
            <p><span class="math">margin(S) = C - 1 - N<sub>passers</sub>(S + 1)</span></p>

            <p>For IDs to <strong>NOT</strong> affect bubbles, all players who are safe must have:</p>
            <p><span class="math">margin(S) ≥ 1</span></p>

            <p>This means they can tolerate at least one additional potential passer and still be safe.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>5.1 Small Cut Sizes (C ≤ 4)</h3>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> With small cut sizes, the safety margin is naturally small.</p>

            <p>Example with C = 4, R = 5, in round 4 (r = 1):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If player has score S = 12 and N_passers(13) = 2, then margin = 4 - 1 - 2 = 1</li>
                <li>If N_passers(12) = 3, then losing would give N_passers(12) = 3 ≥ 4? No, still safe</li>
                <li>But if N_passers(12) = 4, then losing gives N_passers(12) = 4 ≥ 4, NOT safe!</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> With small cuts, players are more likely to be at the safety boundary.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>5.2 Large Cut Sizes (C ≥ 8)</h3>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> With large cut sizes, there's more "room" in the safety margin.</p>

            <p>Example with C = 8, R = 5, in round 4 (r = 1):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If player has score S = 12 and N_passers(13) = 6, then margin = 8 - 1 - 6 = 1</li>
                <li>Even if N_passers(12) = 7, losing still gives margin ≥ 0, so still safe</li>
                <li>Need N_passers(12) = 8 to become unsafe, which requires more players in similar score range</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> With larger cuts, players need to be closer to more competitors to be at the
                boundary.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>5.3 Number of Rounds</h3>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> More rounds means more point spread, fewer players in similar ranges.</p>

            <p>With R = 3 rounds:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maximum score spread: 0 to 9 points</li>
                <li>Many players can be in similar score ranges</li>
                <li>Higher probability of players being at safety boundary</li>
            </ul>

            <p>With R = 7 rounds:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maximum score spread: 0 to 21 points</li>
                <li>Players are more spread out</li>
                <li>Fewer players in similar score ranges near the cut</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Fewer rounds → more clustering → higher chance IDs affect bubbles.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>6. Formal Characterization</h2>

        <div class="proof">
            <h3>Theorem 1: Necessary Condition for IDs to NOT Affect Bubbles</h3>

            <p><strong>If IDs cannot affect bubble statistics, then for all players A, B who are safe to draw:</strong>
            </p>

            <p><span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S<sub>A</sub> + 1) ≤ C - 2</span> or equivalently <span
                    class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S<sub>A</sub>) ≤ C - 1</span></p>

            <p><strong>Proof:</strong> If IDs cannot affect bubbles, then losing instead of drawing cannot change safety
                status. Therefore:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S<sub>A</sub> + 1) < C</span> (safe after draw)</li>
                <li><span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S<sub>A</sub>) < C</span> (safe after loss)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Since <span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S<sub>A</sub>) ≥ N<sub>passers</sub>(S<sub>A</sub> +
                    1)</span>, we need at least a margin of 1, giving the condition above.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
            <h3>Theorem 2: Sufficient Condition (Sufficiently Large Safety Margins)</h3>

            <p><strong>If for all tournament states where IDs occur, all safe players have:</strong></p>

            <p><span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S + 1) ≤ C - 2</span></p>

            <p><strong>Then IDs cannot affect bubble statistics.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Proof:</strong> If <span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S + 1) ≤ C - 2</span>, then:</p>

            <p><span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S) ≤ N<sub>passers</sub>(S + 1) + k</span></p>

            <p>where <span class="math">k</span> is the number of players who can reach <span class="math">S</span> but
                not <span class="math">S + 1</span>.</p>

            <p>The maximum <span class="math">k</span> is bounded by the tournament structure, but even in worst case:
            </p>

            <p><span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S) ≤ C - 2 + k < C</span> (for sufficiently separated players)</p>

            <p>Therefore, losing instead of drawing maintains safety.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>7. Practical Characterization</h2>

        <div class="characterization">
            <h3>When IDs are UNLIKELY to Affect Bubbles:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Large cut size (C ≥ 8):</strong> More "room" in the cut means players are safer, larger
                    safety margins</li>
                <li><strong>Many rounds (R ≥ 6):</strong> Greater point spread means fewer players clustered near cut
                    line</li>
                <li><strong>Early tournament stage:</strong> But IDs only occur in last 2 rounds, so this is fixed</li>
                <li><strong>High draw chance:</strong> More unintentional draws reduce the number of ID opportunities
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>When IDs are MORE LIKELY to Affect Bubbles:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Small cut size (C ≤ 4):</strong> Tight cut means players closer to boundary</li>
                <li><strong>Few rounds (R ≤ 4):</strong> Less point spread means more players in similar ranges</li>
                <li><strong>Low draw chance:</strong> More deterministic outcomes create clearer score clusters</li>
                <li><strong>Large player pools:</strong> More players increases chance of having exactly C-1 or C
                    players in a score range</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>8. Mathematical Relationship</h2>

        <p>The key relationship is:</p>

        <div class="theorem">
            <p><strong>IDs affect bubbles</strong> ⇔ <span class="math">∃</span> players A, B such that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S<sub>A</sub> + 1) = C - 1</span> (exactly at boundary)</li>
                <li><span class="math">N<sub>passers</sub>(S<sub>A</sub>) ≥ C</span> (would cross boundary if lose)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This requires: There exist at least <span class="math">C</span> players (excluding A, B) who can reach
                score <span class="math">S<sub>A</sub></span>.</p>

        <h2>10. Conclusion</h2>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> IDs can affect bubble statistics when players are "barely safe" (at the exact
                safety threshold). This is more likely to occur with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Small cut sizes (C ≤ 4)</strong> - creates tighter boundaries</li>
                <li><strong>Few rounds (R ≤ 4)</strong> - creates score clustering</li>
                <li><strong>Large player pools</strong> - increases probability of having exactly C players in a score
                    range</li>
            </ul>

            <p>IDs are unlikely to affect bubbles when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Large cut sizes (C ≥ 8)</strong> - larger safety margins</li>
                <li><strong>Many rounds (R ≥ 6)</strong> - greater point spread, less clustering</li>
                <li><strong>Safety margins ≥ 1</strong> for all players who would ID</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The relationship is not a simple function of C and R alone, but depends on
                the distribution of player scores near the cut line. However, smaller cuts and fewer rounds increase the
                probability of score clustering, which increases the likelihood that IDs can affect bubble statistics.
